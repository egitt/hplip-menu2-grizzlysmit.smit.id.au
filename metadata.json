  "description": "control your hp printers by calling the device manager hp-toolbox, also some useful links\nMotivation: the hp-systray doesn't work reliably under gnome shell\nyou need to have installed hplip in order to use this\nChoice of using a printer icon or a hp_logo.png if it's installed in the same place as mine on Ubuntu\nyou could use symbolic links to fake the path.\nThis is a replacement for the old \"Alternate Menu for Hplip\" which doesn't work under the new Gome-Shell I have cleaned it up a bit and it has a few new menu's but it is still basically the same thing.\n Added even more menus all most all system settings ones.\n\nNote: the menu will be too big if your resolution is way too low like 800x600 I have no soln for this just now.",
